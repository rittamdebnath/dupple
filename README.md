Dupple is first project on github that i've done . it is just a simple website comprises of html5,css3,js . I have used Bootstrap framework and Semantic-UI icons with some parallax effect which i tried to include but i think some work is yet to be done .(So i commented it out Of course you can checkit out)

i want to much more responsive , for now it is working fine for 
@media(min-width:1200px){
}

but not in the tablet version or mobile i want to be more flexible


all the photos are taken from https://uifaces.com i love this site for its color variant and ease on it's transition .https://ihatetomatoes.net has also helped me alot for creating the parallax effect thanks to Petr Tichy
