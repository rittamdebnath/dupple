Dupple is first project on github that i've done . it is just a simple website comprises of html5,css3,js . I have used Bootstrap framework and Semantic-UI icons with some parallax effect which i tried to include but i think some work is yet to be done .(So i commented it out Of course you can checkit out)

i want to much more responsive , for now it is working fine for 
@media(min-width:1200px){
}
